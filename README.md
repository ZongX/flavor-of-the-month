# Flavor of the Month

## Description:
Web app designed with React to help beginners programmers stay up to date with the most popular languages and frameworks. It makes a request
to the Github API for the repositories with the most stars, compares the activity of different repositories, and renders the result ba
ck to the user. Users can also compare different languages using the "Battle" section, which compares two different users on Gtihub and 
determines a winner based on the number of followers and stars.

## Coming up (in no particular order):
Backend with Node.js to allow users to create accounts and "favorite" languages.
<br/>
UI for rendering statistics and latest activities of a repository.
<br/>
Animations and polishing on the front-end
